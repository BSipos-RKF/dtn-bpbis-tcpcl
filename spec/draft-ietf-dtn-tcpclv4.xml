      <t>
This document describes a TCP-based convergence layer (TCPCL) for 
Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).
This version of the TCPCL protocol resolves implementation issues in the
earlier TCPCL Version 3 of RFC7242 and updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP) 
contents, encodings, and convergence layer requirements in BP Version 7.
Specifically, the TCPCLv4 uses CBOR-encoded BPv7 bundles as its service data
unit being transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles.
This version of TCPCL also includes security and extensibility mechanisms.

    <section anchor="sec-intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This document describes the TCP-based convergence-layer protocol for
        Delay-Tolerant Networking. Delay-Tolerant Networking is an end-to-
        end architecture providing communications in and/or through highly
        stressed environments, including those with intermittent
        connectivity, long and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates.
        More detailed descriptions of the rationale and capabilities of these
        networks can be found in &quot;Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture&quot;
        <xref target="RFC4838" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        An important goal of the DTN architecture is to accommodate a wide
        range of networking technologies and environments. The protocol used
        for DTN communications is the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7)
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis" />,
        an
        application-layer protocol that is used to construct a store-and-forward
        overlay network.
        BPv7 requires the services of a &quot;convergence-layer adapter&quot; (CLA)
        to send and receive bundles using the service of
        some &quot;native&quot; link, network, or Internet protocol.
        This document describes one such convergence-layer adapter that uses the
        well-known Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
        This convergence layer is referred to as TCP Convergence Layer Version 4 (TCPCLv4).
        For the remainder of this document, the abbreviation &quot;BP&quot;
        without the version suffix refers to BPv7.
        For the remainder of this document, the abbreviation &quot;TCPCL&quot;
        without the version suffix refers to TCPCLv4.
      </t>
      <t>
        The locations of the TCPCL and the BP in the Internet model protocol
        stack (described in
        <xref target="RFC1122" />) are shown in Figure 1.
        In particular, when BP is using TCP as its bearer with TCPCL as its
        convergence layer, both BP and TCPCL reside at the application layer
        of the Internet model.

          This document describes the format of the protocol data units passed

            <t>
              The format of protocol data units of the Bundle Protocol, as those
              are defined elsewhere in
              <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis" />.
              This includes the concept of bundle fragmentation or bundle encapsulation.
              The TCPCL transfers bundles as opaque data blocks.

            <t>
              Mechanisms for locating or identifying other bundle entities
              (peers) within a network or across an internet.
              The mapping of Node ID to potential convergence layer (CL)
              protocol and network address
              is left to implementation and configuration of the BP Agent

            <t hangText="TCPCL Entity:">
              This is the notional TCPCL application that initiates TCPCL sessions.
              This design, implementation, configuration, and specific behavior of such
              an entity is outside of the scope of this document.
              However, the concept of an entity has utility within the scope of 
              this document as the container and initiator of TCPCL sessions.
              The relationship between a TCPCL entity and TCPCL sessions is defined as follows:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  A TCPCL Entity MAY actively initiate any number of TCPCL Sessions and should do so 
                  whenever the entity is the initial transmitter of information to another entity in the network.
                </t>
                <t>
                  A TCPCL Entity MAY support zero or more passive listening elements that listen for
                  connection requests from other TCPCL Entities operating on other entities in the network.
                </t>
                <t>
                  A TCPCL Entity MAY passively initiate any number of TCPCL Sessions from requests received
                  by its passive listening element(s) if the entity uses such elements.
                </t>
              </list>
              These relationships are illustrated in <xref target="fig-entity-session-relations"/>.
              For most TCPCL behavior within a session, the two entities are 
              symmetric and there is no protocol distinction between them.
              Some specific behavior, particularly during session establishment, distinguishes
              between the active entity and the passive entity.
              For the remainder of this document, the term &quot;entity&quot;
              without the prefix &quot;TCPCL&quot; refers to a TCPCL entity.
            </t>
            <t hangText="TCP Connection:">
              The term Connection in this specification exclusively refers to 
              a TCP connection and any and all behaviors, sessions, and other 
              states associated with that TCP connection.
            </t>
            <t hangText="TCPCL Session:">
              A TCPCL session (as opposed to a TCP connection) is a TCPCL 
              communication relationship between two TCPCL entities.
              A TCPCL session operates within a single underlying TCP connection
              and the lifetime of a TCPCL session is bound to the lifetime of 
              that TCP connection.
              A TCPCL session is terminated when the TCP
              connection ends, due either to one or both entities actively
              closing the TCP connection or due to network errors causing
              a failure of the TCP connection.
              Within a single TCPCL session there are two possible transfer streams;
              one in each direction, with one stream from each entity being the outbound
              stream and the other being the inbound stream 
              (see <xref target="fig-session-stream" />).
              From the perspective of a TCPCL session, the two transfer streams 
              do not logically interact with each other.
              The streams do operate over the same TCP connection and between the 
              same BP agents, so there are logical relationships at those layers
              (message and bundle interleaving respectively).
              For the remainder of this document, the term &quot;session&quot;
              without the prefix &quot;TCPCL&quot; refers to a TCPCL session.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Session parameters:">
              These are a set of
              values used to affect the operation of the TCPCL for a given
              session. The manner in which these parameters are conveyed
              to the bundle entity and thereby to the TCPCL is implementation
              dependent. However, the mechanism by which two entities
              exchange and negotiate the values to be used for a given session
              is described in
              <xref target="sec-contact-negotiate" />.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Transfer Stream:">
              A Transfer stream is a uni-directional user-data path within a TCPCL Session.
              Transfers sent over a transfer stream are serialized, meaning that one 
              transfer must complete its transmission prior to another transfer 
              being started over the same transfer stream.
              At the stream layer there is no logical relationship between transfers 
              in that stream; it's only within the BP agent that transfers are
              fully decoded as bundles.
              Each uni-directional stream has a single sender entity and a single receiver entity.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Transfer:">
              This refers to the procedures and mechanisms
              for conveyance of an individual bundle from one node to
              another.
              Each transfer within TCPCL is identified by a Transfer ID number
              which is guaranteed to be unique only to a single direction 
              within a single Session.

              A TCPCL session is idle while there is no transmission in-progress

      <t>
        The service of this protocol is the transmission of DTN bundles via
        the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
        This document specifies the encapsulation of bundles,
        procedures for TCP setup and teardown, and a set of messages and node
        requirements.
        The general operation of the protocol is as follows.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-cl-services" title="Convergence Layer Services">
        <t>
          This version of the TCPCL provides the following services to support
          the overlaying Bundle Protocol agent.
          In all cases, this is not an API definition but a logical description
          of how the CL can interact with the BP agent.
          Each of these interactions can be associated with any number of 
          additional metadata items as necessary to support the operation
          of the CL or BP agent.
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Attempt Session:">
              The TCPCL allows a BP agent to preemptively attempt to establish
              a TCPCL session with a peer entity.
              Each session attempt can send a different set of session negotiation
              parameters as directed by the BP agent.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Terminate Session:">
              The TCPCL allows a BP agent to preemptively terminate an established
              TCPCL session with a peer entity.
              The terminate request is on a per-session basis.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Session State Changed:">
              The TCPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when the session state changes.

                <t hangText="Ending:">The entity sent SESS_TERM message and is in the ending state.</t>
                <t hangText="Terminated:">The session has finished normal termination sequencing.</t>

              </list>
            </t>
            <t hangText="Session Idle Changed:">
              The TCPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when the live/idle sub-state of
              the session changes.
              This occurs only when the top-level session state is 
              &quot;Established&quot;.
              The session transitions from Idle to Live at the at the start
              of a transfer in either transfer stream;
              the session transitions from Live to Idle at the end of a 
              transfer when the other transfer stream does not have an ongoing
              transfer.
              Because TCPCL transmits serially over a TCP connection it suffers
              from "head of queue blocking," so a transfer in either direction
              can block an immediate start of a new transfer in the session.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Begin Transmission:">
              The principal purpose of the TCPCL is to allow a BP agent to
              transmit bundle data over an established TCPCL session.
              Transmission request is on a per-session basis and the CL does not
              necessarily perform any per-session or inter-session queueing.
              Any queueing of transmissions is the obligation of the BP agent.

            <t hangText="Transmission Intermediate Progress:">
              The TCPCL entity indicates to the BP agent on intermediate progress
              of transfer to a peer entity.
              This intermediate progress is at the granularity of each
              transferred segment.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Transmission Failure:">
              The TCPCL entity indicates to the BP agent on certain reasons for
              bundle transmission failure, notably when the peer entity rejects
              the bundle or when a TCPCL session ends before transfer success.
              The TCPCL itself does not have a notion of transfer timeout.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Reception Initialized:">
              The TCPCL entity indicates to the receiving BP agent just before any
              transmission data is sent.
              This corresponds to reception of the XFER_SEGMENT message with
              the START flag of 1.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Interrupt Reception:">
              The TCPCL entity allows a BP agent to interrupt an individual transfer
              before it has fully completed (successfully or not).
              Interruption can occur any time after the reception is initialized.

              This intermediate progress is at the granularity of each
              transferred segment.
              Intermediate reception indication allows a BP agent the chance
              to inspect bundle header contents before the entire bundle is
              available, and thus supports the
              &quot;Reception Interruption&quot; capability.

              ends before transfer success.

      <section anchor="sec-protocol-session" title="TCPCL Session Overview">
        <t>
          First, one node establishes a TCPCL session to the other by
          initiating a TCP connection in accordance with
          <xref target="RFC0793" />.
          After setup of the TCP connection is
          complete, an initial Contact Header is exchanged in both directions
          to establish a shared TCPCL version and negotiate the use of
          TLS security (as described in <xref target="sec-session-establishment" />).
          Once contact negotiation is complete, TCPCL messaging is available and
          the session negotiation is used to set parameters of the TCPCL session.
          One of these parameters is a Node ID that each TCPCL Entity is acting as.
          This is used to assist in routing and forwarding messages by the 
          BP Agent and is part of the authentication capability provided by TLS.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once negotiated, the parameters of a TCPCL session cannot change
          and if there is a desire by either peer to transfer data under 
          different parameters then a new session must be established.
          This makes CL logic simpler but relies on the assumption that
          establishing a TCP connection is lightweight enough that TCP 
          connection overhead is negligible compared to TCPCL data sizes.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once the TCPCL session is established and configured in this way,
          bundles can be transferred in either direction.
          Each transfer is performed by segmenting the transfer data into 
          one or more XFER_SEGMENT messages.
          Multiple bundles can be transmitted consecutively in a single 
          direction on a single TCPCL connection.
          Segments from different bundles are never interleaved.
          Bundle interleaving can be
          accomplished by fragmentation at the BP layer or by establishing multiple
          TCPCL sessions between the same peers.
          There is no fundamental limit on the number of TCPCL sessions which
          a single node can establish beyond the limit imposed by the number
          of available (ephemeral) TCP ports of the active entity.
        </t>
        <t>
          A feature of this protocol is for the receiving node to send
          acknowledgment (XFER_ACK) messages as bundle data segments arrive. The
          rationale behind these acknowledgments is to enable the sender node
          to determine how much of the bundle has been received, so that in
          case the session is interrupted, it can perform reactive
          fragmentation to avoid re-sending the already transmitted part of the
          bundle.
          In addition, there is no explicit flow control on the TCPCL
          layer.
        </t>
        <t>
          A TCPCL receiver can interrupt the
          transmission of a bundle at any point in time by replying with a
          XFER_REFUSE message, which causes the sender to stop transmission
          of the associated bundle (if it hasn't already finished transmission)
          Note: This enables a cross-layer optimization in
          that it allows a receiver that detects that it already has received a
          certain bundle to interrupt transmission as early as possible and
          thus save transmission capacity for other bundles.
        </t>
        <t>
          For sessions that are idle, a KEEPALIVE message is
          sent at a negotiated interval.
          This is used to convey node live-ness information during otherwise
          message-less time intervals.
        </t>
        <t>
          A SESS_TERM message is used to initiate the ending of a TCPCL session
          (see <xref target="sec-SESS_TERM" />).
          During termination sequencing, in-progress transfers can be completed but no
          new transfers can be initiated.
          A SESS_TERM message can also be used to refuse a session setup by a
          peer (see
          <xref target="sec-contact-negotiate" />).
          Regardless of the reason, session termination is initiated by one
          of the entities and responded-to by the other as illustrated by
          <xref target="fig-sessterm-init" /> and 
          <xref target="fig-sessterm-respond" />.
          Even when there are no transfers queued or in-progress, the session
          termination procedure allows each entity to distinguish between
          a clean end to a session and the TCP connection being closed because
          of some underlying network issue.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once a session is established, TCPCL is a symmetric protocol between the peers.
          Both sides can start sending data segments in a session, and one
          side's bundle transfer does not have to complete before the other
          side can start sending data segments on its own. Hence, the protocol
          allows for a bi-directional mode of communication.
          Note that in the case of concurrent bidirectional transmission,
          acknowledgment segments MAY be interleaved with data segments.

        Contact negotiation involves exchanging a Contact Header (CH) in both
        directions and deriving a negotiated state from the two headers.
        The contact negotiation sequencing is performed either as the
        active or passive entity, and is illustrated in <xref target="fig-contact-init-active"/>
        and <xref target="fig-contact-init-passive"/> respectively which both share the data
        validation and negotiation of the 
        Processing of Contact Header "[PCH]" activity of
        <xref target="fig-contact-init-process"/> and the "[TCPCLOSE]" activity
        which indicates TCP connection close.
        Successful negotiation results in one of the Session Initiation "[SI]" 
        activities being performed.
        To avoid data loss, a Session Termination "[ST]" exchange allows
        cleanly finishing transfers before a session is ended.

          Session termination involves one entity initiating the termination
          of the session and the other entity acknowledging the termination.
          For either entity, it is the sending of the SESS_TERM message which
          transitions the session to the Ending substate.
          While a session is in the Ending state only in-progress transfers can
          be completed and no new transfers can be started.

        <t>
This specification gives requirements about how to use PKIX certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), but does not define any mechanisms for how those certificates come to be.
The requirements about TCPCL certificate use are broad to support two quite different PKIX environments:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="DTN-Aware CAs:">
In the ideal case, the CA(s) issuing certificates for TCPCL entities are aware of the end use of the certificate, have a mechanism for verifying ownership of a Node ID, and are issuing certificates directly for that Node ID.
In this environment, the ability to authenticate a peer entity Node ID directly avoids the need to authenticate a network name or address and then implicitly trust Node ID of the peer.
The TCPCL authenticates the Node ID whenever possible and this is preferred over lower-level PKIX identifiers.
            </t>
            <t hangText="DTN-Ignorant CAs:">
It is expected that Internet-scale "public" CAs will continue to focus on DNS names as the preferred PKIX identifier.
There are large infrastructures already in-place for managing network-level authentication and protocols to manage identity verification in those environments <xref target="RFC8555" />.
The TCPCL allows for this type of environment by authenticating a lower-level identifier for a peer and requiring the entity to trust that the Node ID given by the peer (during session initialization) is valid.
This situation not ideal, as it allows vulnerabilities described in <xref target="sec-threat-node-impersonation" />, but still provides some amount of mutual authentication to take place for a TCPCL session.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
Even within a single TCPCL session, each entity may operate within different PKI environments and with different identifier limitations.
The requirements related to identifiers in in a PKIX certificate are in <xref target="sec-tls-identification" />.
        </t>
        <t>
It is important for interoperability that a TCPCL entity have its own security policy tailored to accommodate the peers with which it is expected to operate.
A strict TLS security policy is appropriate for a private network with a single shared CA.
Operation on the Internet (such as inter-site BP gateways) could trade more lax TCPCL security with the use of encrypted bundle encapsulation <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bibect" /> to ensure strong bundle security.

      <section anchor="sec-session-keeping" title="Session Keeping Policies">
        <t>
This specification gives requirements about how to initiate, sustain, and terminate a TCPCL session but does not impose any requirements on how sessions need to be managed by a BP agent.
It is a network administration matter to determine an appropriate session keeping policy, but guidance given here can be used to steer policy toward performance goals.
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Persistent Session:">
This policy preemptively establishes a single session to known entities in the network and keeps the session active using KEEPALIVEs.
Benefits of this policy include reducing the total amount of TCP data needing to be exchanged for a set of transfers (assuming KEEPALIVE size is significantly smaller than transfer size), and allowing the session state to indicate peer connectivity.
Drawbacks include wasted network resources when a session is mostly idle or when the network connectivity is inconsistent (which requires re-establishing failed sessions), and potential queueing issues when multiple transfers are requested simultaneously.
This policy assumes that there is agreement between pairs of entities as to which of the peers will initiate sessions; if there is no such agreement, there is potential for duplicate sessions to be established between peers.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Ephemeral Sessions:">
This policy only establishes a session when an outgoing transfer is needed to be sent.
Benefits of this policy include not wasting network resources on sessions which are idle for long periods of time, and avoids queueing issues of a persistent session.
Drawbacks include the TCP and TLS overhead of establish a new session for each transfer.
This policy assumes that each entity can function in a passive role to listen for session requests from any peer which needs to send a transfer; when that is not the case the Polling behavior below needs to happen.
This policy can be augmented to keep the session established as long as any transfers are queued.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Active-Only Polling Sessions:">
When naming and/or addressing of one entity is variable (i.e. dynamically assigned IP address or domain name) or when firewall or routing rules prevent incoming TCP connections, that entity can only function in the active role.
In these cases, sessions also need to be established when an incoming transfer is expected from a peer or based on a periodic schedule.
This polling behavior causes inefficiencies compared to as-needed ephemeral sessions.
            </t>
          </list>
Many other policies can be established in a TCPCL network between the two extremes of single persistent sessions and only ephemeral sessions.
Different policies can be applied to each peer entity and to each bundle as it needs to be transferred (e.g for quality of service).
Additionally, future session extension types can apply further nuance to session policies and policy negotiation.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-transfer-segmentation" title="Transfer Segmentation Policies">
        <t>
Each TCPCL session allows a negotiated transfer segmentation polcy to be applied in each transfer direction.
A receiving node can set the Segment MRU in its SESS_INIT message to determine the largest acceptable segment size, and a transmitting node can segment a transfer into any sizes smaller than the receiver's Segment MRU.
It is a network administration matter to determine an appropriate segmentation policy for entities operating TCPCL, but guidance given here can be used to steer policy toward performance goals.
It is also advised to consider the Segment MRU in relation to chunking/packetization performed by TLS, TCP, and any intermediate network-layer nodes.
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Minimum Overhead:">
For a simple network expected to exchange relatively small bundles, the Segment MRU can be set to be identical to the Transfer MRU which indicates that all transfers can be sent with a single data segment (i.e., no actual segmentation).
If the network is closed and all transmitters are known to follow a single-segment transfer policy, then receivers can avoid the necessity of segment reassembly.
Because this CL operates over a TCP stream, which suffers from a form of head-of-queue blocking between messages, while one node is transmitting a single XFER_SEGMENT message it is not able to transmit any XFER_ACK or XFER_REFUSE for any associated received transfers.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Predictable Message Sizing:">
In situations where the maximum message size is desired to be well-controlled, the Segment MRU can be set to the largest acceptable size (the message size less XFER_SEGMENT header size) and transmitters can always segment a transfer into maximum-size chunks no larger than the Segment MRU.
This guarantees that any single XFER_SEGMENT will not monopolize the TCP stream for too long, which would prevent outgoing XFER_ACK and XFER_REFUSE associated with received transfers.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Dynamic Segmentation:">
Even after negotiation of a Segment MRU for each receiving node, the actual transfer segmentation only needs to guarantee than any individual segment is no larger than that MRU.
In a situation where TCP throughput is dynamic, the transfer segmentation size can also be dynamic in order to control message transmission duration.
            </t>
          </list>
Many other policies can be established in a TCPCL network between the two extremes of minimum overhead (large MRU, single-segment) and predictable message sizing (small MRU, highly segmented).
Different policies can be applied to each transfer stream to and from any particular node.
Additionally, future session extension and transfer extension types can apply further nuance to transfer policies and policy negotiation.

          The following figure depicts the protocol exchange for a
          simple session, showing the session establishment and the
          transmission of a single bundle split into three data segments (of

          Note that the sending node can transmit multiple XFER_SEGMENT
          messages without waiting for the corresponding
          XFER_ACK responses. This enables pipelining of messages on a
          transfer stream. Although this example only demonstrates a single bundle
          transmission, it is also possible to pipeline multiple XFER_SEGMENT
          messages for different bundles without necessarily waiting for
          XFER_ACK messages to be returned for each one. However,
          interleaving data segments from different bundles is not allowed.

    <section anchor="sec-session-establishment" title="Session Establishment">
      <t>
        For bundle transmissions to occur using the TCPCL, a TCPCL session
        MUST first be established between communicating entities. It is up to
        the implementation to decide how and when session setup is
        triggered. For example, some sessions can be opened proactively
        and maintained for as long as is possible given the network
        conditions, while other sessions are be opened only when there is
        a bundle that is queued for transmission and the routing algorithm
        selects a certain next-hop node.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-tcp-connection" title="TCP Connection">
        <t>
          To establish a TCPCL session, an entity MUST first establish a TCP
          connection with the intended peer entity, typically by using the
          services provided by the operating system.
          Destination port number 4556 has been assigned by IANA as the Registered
          Port number for the TCP convergence layer.
          Other destination port numbers MAY be used per local configuration.
          Determining a peer's destination port number (if different from the
          registered TCPCL port number) is up to the implementation.
          Any source port number MAY be used for TCPCL sessions.
          Typically an operating system assigned number in the TCP Ephemeral range
          (49152-65535) is used.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the entity is unable to establish a TCP connection for any reason,
          then it is an implementation matter to determine how to handle the
          connection failure. An entity MAY decide to re-attempt to establish the
          connection. If it does so, it MUST NOT overwhelm its target with
          repeated connection attempts. 
          Therefore, the entity MUST NOT retry the connection setup earlier than 
          some delay time from the last attempt,
          and it SHOULD use a (binary) exponential back-off
          mechanism to increase this delay in case of repeated failures.
          The upper limit on a re-attempt back-off is implementation defined
          but SHOULD be no longer than one minute (60 seconds) before signaling to the
          BP agent that a connection cannot be made.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once a TCP connection is established, the active entity SHALL immediately
          transmit its Contact Header.
          Once a TCP connection is established, the passive entity SHALL wait
          for the peer's Contact Header.
          If the passive entity does not receive a Contact Header after
          some implementation-defined time duration after TCP connection is
          established, the entity SHALL close the TCP connection.
          Entities SHOULD choose a Contact Header reception timeout interval no 
          longer than one minute (60 seconds).
          Upon reception of a Contact Header, the passive entity SHALL transmit
          its Contact Header.
          The ordering of the Contact Header exchange allows the passive entity
          to avoid allocating resources to a potential TCPCL session until
          after a valid Contact Header has been received from the active entity.
          This ordering also allows the passive peer to adapt to alternate
          TCPCL protocol versions.

          The format of the Contact Header is described in
          <xref target="sec-contact-header" />.
          Because the TCPCL protocol version in use is part of the initial 
          Contact Header, nodes using TCPCL version 4 can coexist on a network
          with nodes using earlier TCPCL versions (with some negotiation needed
          for interoperation as described in

          If an entity is capable of exchanging messages according to 
          TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" /> or any successors 
          which are compatible with that TLS ClientHello, the the CAN_TLS flag
          within its Contact Header SHALL be set to 1.
          This behavior prefers the use of TLS when possible, even if security
          policy does not allow or require authentication.
          This follows the opportunistic security model of <xref target="RFC7435" />.

          Upon receipt of the Contact Header, both entities perform the validation

        <t>
          Upon reception of the Contact Header, each node follows the following
          procedures to ensure the validity of the TCPCL session and to
          negotiate values for the session parameters.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the magic string is not present or is not valid, the connection
          MUST be terminated.
          The intent of the magic string is to provide
          some protection against an inadvertent TCP connection by a different
          protocol than the one described in this document.
          To prevent a flood of repeated connections from a misconfigured 
          application, a passive entity MAY deny new TCP connections from a specific
          peer address for a period of time after one or more connections
          fail to provide a decodable Contact Header.
        </t>
        <t>
          The first negotiation is on the TCPCL protocol version to use.
          The active entity always sends its Contact Header first and waits for
          a response from the passive entity.
          During contact initiation, the active TCPCL node SHALL send the highest TCPCL protocol
          version on a first session attempt for a TCPCL peer.
          If the active entity receives a Contact Header with a lower
          protocol version than the one sent earlier on the TCP connection,
          the TCP connection SHALL be closed.
          If the active entity receives a SESS_TERM message with reason of
          "Version Mismatch", that node MAY attempt further TCPCL sessions with the
          peer using earlier protocol version numbers in decreasing order.
          Managing multi-TCPCL-session state such as this is an implementation matter.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the passive entity receives a Contact Header containing a version that is
          not a version of the TCPCL that the entity
          implements, then the entity SHALL send its Contact Header and 
          immediately terminate the session with a reason code
          of "Version mismatch".
          If the passive entity receives a Contact Header with a
          version that is lower than the latest version of the protocol that the entity
          implements, the entity MAY either terminate the session (with a reason code
          of "Version mismatch") or adapt its operation to
          conform to the older version of the protocol.
          The decision of version fall-back is an implementation matter.

              A local security policy is then applied to determine of the negotiated value
              of Enable TLS is acceptable.
              It can be a reasonable security policy to require or disallow
              the use of TLS depending upon the desired network flows.
              Because this state is negotiated over an unsecured medium,
              there is a risk of a TLS Stripping as described in <xref target="sec-security" />.
              If the Enable TLS state is unacceptable, the entity SHALL terminate

          This version of the TCPCL supports establishing a Transport
          Layer Security (TLS) session within an existing TCP connection.
          When TLS is used within the TCPCL it affects the entire session.
          Once TLS is established, there is no mechanism available to downgrade the
          TCPCL session to non-TLS operation.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once established, the lifetime of a TLS connection SHALL be bound 
          to the lifetime of the underlying TCP connection.
          Immediately prior to actively ending a TLS connection after TCPCL 
          session termination, the peer which sent the original (non-reply)
          SESS_TERM message SHOULD follow the Closure Alert procedure of
          <xref target="RFC8446" /> to cleanly terminate the TLS connection.
          Because each TCPCL message is either fixed-length or self-indicates
          its length, the lack of a TLS Closure Alert will not cause
          data truncation or corruption.
        </t>
        <t>
          Subsequent TCPCL session attempts to the same passive entity MAY 
          attempt use the TLS connection resumption feature.
          There is no guarantee that the passive entity will accept the request
          to resume a TLS session, and the active entity cannot assume any
          resumption outcome.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec-tls-identification" title="Entity Identification">
          <t>
            The TCPCL uses TLS for certificate exchange in both directions
            to identify each entity and to allow each entity to authenticate 
            its peer.
            Each certificate can potentially identify multiple entities and
            there is no problem using such a certificate as long as the
            identifiers are sufficient to meet authentication policy 
            (as described in later sections) for the entity which presents it.
          </t>
          <t>
Because the PKIX environment of each TCPCL entity are likely not controlled by the certificate end users (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env" />), the TCPCL defines a prioritized list of what a certificate can identify about a TCPCL entity:
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Node ID:">
The ideal certificate identity is the Node ID of the entity using the NODE-ID definition below.
When the Node ID is identified, there is no need for any lower-level identification to take place.
              </t>
              <t hangText="DNS Name:">
If CA policy forbids a certificate to contain an arbitrary NODE-ID but allows a DNS-ID to be identified then one or more stable host names can be identified in the certificate.
The use of wildcard DNS-ID is discouraged due to the complex rules for matching and dependence on implementation support for wildcard matching (see Section 6.4.3 of <xref target="RFC6125" />).
              </t>
              <t hangText="Network Address:">
If no stable host name is available but a stable network address is available and CA policy allows a certificate to contain a NETWORK-ID (as defined below) then one or more network addresses can be identified in the certificate.
              </t>
            </list>
When only a DNS-ID or NETWORK-ID can be identified by a certificate, it is implied that an entity which authenticates using that certificate is trusted to provide a valid Node ID in its SESS_INIT; the certificate itself does not actually authenticate that Node ID.
          </t>
          <t>
The RECOMMENDED security policy of an entity is to validate a peer which authenticates its Node ID regardless of an authenticated host name or address, and only consider the host/address authentication in the absence of an authenticated Node ID.
          </t>
          <t>
            This specification defines a NODE-ID of a certificate as being 
            the subjectAltName entry of type uniformResourceIdentifier 
            whose value is a URI consistent with the requirements
            of <xref target="RFC3986" /> and the URI schemes of
            the IANA "Bundle Protocol URI Scheme Type" registry.
            This is similar to the URI-ID of <xref target="RFC6125" /> but does
            not require any structure to the scheme-specific-part of the URI.
            Unless specified otherwise by the definition of the URI scheme 
            being authenticated,
            URI matching of a NODE-ID SHALL use the URI comparison logic of
            <xref target="RFC3986" /> and scheme-based normalization of
            those schemes specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis" />.
            A URI scheme can refine this "exact match" logic with rules
            about how Node IDs within that scheme are to be compared with
            the certificate-authenticated NODE-ID.
          </t>
          <t>
            This specification defines a NETWORK-ID of a certificate as
            being the subjectAltName entry of type iPAddress whose value is encoded
            according to <xref target="RFC5280" />.

            After negotiating an Enable TLS parameter of true, and before any other
            TCPCL messages are sent within the session, the session entities SHALL
            begin a TLS handshake in accordance with <xref target="RFC8446" />.
            By convention, this protocol uses the entity which initiated the
            underlying TCP connection (the active peer) as the &quot;client&quot; role
            of the TLS handshake request.
          </t>

            Using PKIX certificates exchanged during the TLS handshake, each
            of the entities can attempt to authenticate its peer Node ID directly
            or authenticate the peer host name or network address.
            The Node ID exchanged in the Session Initialization is likely to
            be used by the BP agent for making transfer and routing decisions,
            so attempting Node ID validation is required 
            while attempting host name validation is optional.
            The logic for attempting validation is separate from the

            When this &quot;virtual host&quot; behavior is used, the host name
            is used as the indication of which BP Node the active entity

            A virtual host CL entity can be authenticated by a certificate containing
            all of the host names and/or Node IDs being hosted or by several
            certificates each authenticating a single host name and/or Node ID,

            As described in

            a negotiated parameter of each session is the Session Keepalive interval.
            If the negotiated Session Keepalive is zero (i.e., one or both contact
            headers contains a zero Keepalive Interval), then the keepalive feature
            is disabled.
            There is no logical minimum value for the keepalive interval
            (within the minimum imposed by the positive-value encoding), but when
            used for many sessions on an open, shared network a short interval could
            lead to excessive traffic.
            For shared network use, entities SHOULD choose a keepalive interval
            no shorter than 30 seconds.
            There is no logical maximum value for the keepalive interval 
            (within the maximum imposed by the fixed-size encoding), but an
            idle TCP connection is liable for closure by the host operating system
            if the keepalive time is longer than tens-of-minutes.
            Entities SHOULD choose a keepalive interval no longer than 10 minutes
            (600 seconds).
          </t>
          <t>
            Note: The Keepalive Interval SHOULD NOT be chosen too short as TCP
            retransmissions MAY occur in case of packet loss. Those will have to
            be triggered by a timeout (TCP retransmission timeout (RTO)), which
            is dependent on the measured RTT for the TCP connection so that
            KEEPALIVE messages can experience noticeable latency.

            The format of a KEEPALIVE message is a one-octet message type code of

            Both sides SHALL send a KEEPALIVE message whenever the negotiated

            <xref target="sec-SESS_TERM" />) with reason code "Idle Timeout".
            If configurable, the idle timeout duration SHOULD be no shorter 
            than twice the keepalive interval.

        <t>
          All of the messages in this section are directly associated with transferring
          a bundle between TCPCL entities.
        </t>
        <t>
          A single TCPCL transfer results in a bundle (handled by the convergence layer
          as opaque data) being exchanged from one node to the other.
          In TCPCL a transfer is accomplished by dividing a single bundle up into
          &quot;segments&quot; based on the receiving-side Segment MRU
          (see <xref target="sec-contact-header" />).
          The choice of the length to use for segments is an implementation matter,
          but each segment MUST NOT be larger than the receiving node's maximum
          receive unit (MRU)
          (see the field Segment MRU of <xref target="sec-contact-header" />).
          The first segment for a bundle is indicated by the 'START' flag and
          the last segment is indicated by the 'END' flag.
        </t>
        <t>
          A single transfer (and by extension a single segment) SHALL NOT contain data
          of more than a single bundle.
          This requirement is imposed on the agent using the TCPCL rather than TCPCL itself.
        </t>
        <t>
          If multiple bundles are transmitted on a single TCPCL connection,
          they MUST be transmitted consecutively without interleaving of segments from multiple bundles.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec-transfer-id" title="Bundle Transfer ID">
          <t>
            Each of the bundle transfer messages contains a Transfer ID which is
            used to correlate messages (from both sides of a transfer) for each bundle.
            A Transfer ID does not attempt to address uniqueness of the bundle data itself
            and has no relation to concepts such as bundle fragmentation.
            Each invocation of TCPCL by the bundle protocol agent, requesting transmission
            of a bundle (fragmentary or otherwise), results in the initiation of a single
            TCPCL transfer. 
            Each transfer entails the sending of a sequence of
            some number of XFER_SEGMENT and XFER_ACK messages; all are correlated
            by the same Transfer ID.
            The sending entity originates a transfer ID and the receiving entity
            uses that same Transfer ID in acknowledgements.
          </t>
          <t>
            Transfer IDs from each node SHALL be unique within a single TCPCL session.
            Upon exhaustion of the entire 64-bit Transfer ID space, the sending node
            SHALL terminate the session with SESS_TERM reason code "Resource Exhaustion".
            For bidirectional bundle transfers, a TCPCL node SHOULD NOT rely on any
            relation between Transfer IDs originating from each side of the TCPCL session.
          </t>
          <t>
            Although there is not a strict requirement for Transfer ID initial 
            values or ordering (see <xref target="sec-security-xferid" />), 
            in the absence of any other mechanism for
            generating Transfer IDs an entity SHALL use the following algorithm:
            The initial Transfer ID from each node is zero and 
            subsequent Transfer ID values are incremented from the prior Transfer ID
            value by one.

          <t>
            Although the TCP transport provides reliable transfer of data between
            transport peers, the typical BSD sockets interface provides no means
            to inform a sending application of when the receiving application has
            processed some amount of transmitted data.
            Thus, after transmitting some data, the TCPCL needs an additional mechanism to
            determine whether the receiving agent has successfully received 
            and fully processed the segment.
            To this end, the TCPCL protocol provides feedback messaging whereby a
            receiving node transmits acknowledgments of reception of data
            segments.

            The flags portion of the XFER_ACK header SHALL be set to match the

            data length fields of all XFER_SEGMENT messages received so far in the
            course of the indicated transfer.

            After receiving the first segment, the entity sends an acknowledgment

            The TCPCL supports a mechanism by which a receiving node can indicate to
            the sender that it does not want to receive the corresponding bundle.
            To do so, upon receiving an XFER_SEGMENT message, the entity MAY
            transmit a XFER_REFUSE message. As data segments and
            acknowledgments can cross on the wire, the bundle that is being
            refused SHALL be identified by the Transfer ID of the refusal.
          </t>
          <t>
            There is no required relation between the Transfer MRU of a TCPCL
            node (which is supposed to represent a firm limitation of what the
            node will accept) and sending of a XFER_REFUSE message.
            A XFER_REFUSE can be used in cases where the agent's bundle storage is
            temporarily depleted or somehow constrained.
            A XFER_REFUSE can also be used after the bundle header or any bundle data
            is inspected by an agent and determined to be unacceptable.
          </t>
          <t>
            A transfer receiver MAY send an XFER_REFUSE message as soon as it receives
            any XFER_SEGMENT message.
            The transfer sender MUST be prepared for this and MUST associate the refusal
            with the correct bundle via the Transfer ID fields.

          <t>
            The TCPCL itself does not have any required behavior to respond to an
            XFER_REFUSE based on its Reason Code; 
            the refusal is passed up as an indication to the BP agent 
            that the transfer has been refused.
            If a transfer refusal has a Reason Code which is not decodable to 
            the BP agent, the agent SHOULD treat the refusal as having an

            have either acknowledged all XFER_SEGMENT messages or refused the bundle transfer.
          </t>
          <t>
            The bundle transfer refusal MAY be sent before an entire data segment is
            received. If a sender receives a XFER_REFUSE message, the sender
            MUST complete the transmission of any partially sent XFER_SEGMENT
            message. There is no way to interrupt an individual TCPCL message partway
            through sending it.
            The sender MUST NOT commence transmission of any further segments of the
            refused bundle subsequently.
            Note, however, that this requirement does not ensure
            that an entity will not receive another XFER_SEGMENT for the same bundle
            after transmitting a XFER_REFUSE message since messages can cross
            on the wire; if this happens, subsequent segments of the bundle
            SHALL also be refused with a XFER_REFUSE message.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note: If a bundle transmission is aborted in this way, the receiver
            does not receive a segment with the 'END' flag set to 1 for the
            aborted bundle. The beginning of the next bundle is identified by
            the 'START' flag set to 1, indicating the start of a new transfer, and with
            a distinct Transfer ID value.

    <section anchor="sec-termination" title="Session Termination">
      <t>
        This section describes the procedures for terminating a TCPCL session.
        The purpose of terminating a session is to allow transfers to complete
        before the session is closed but not allow any new transfers to start.
        A session state change is necessary for this to happen because transfers
        can be in-progress in either direction (transfer stream) within a session.
        Waiting for a transfer to complete in one direction does not control
        or influence the possibility of a transfer in the other direction.
        Either peer of a session can terminate an established session at any time.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-SESS_TERM" title="Session Termination Message (SESS_TERM)">
        <t>
          To cleanly terminate a session, a SESS_TERM message SHALL be
          transmitted by either node at any point following complete
          transmission of any other message.
          When sent to initiate a termination, the REPLY flag of a SESS_TERM message
          SHALL be 0.
          Upon receiving a SESS_TERM message after not sending a SESS_TERM message in
          the same session, an entity SHALL send an acknowledging SESS_TERM message.
          When sent to acknowledge a termination, a SESS_TERM message SHALL have
          identical data content from the message being acknowledged except for
          the REPLY flag, which is set to 1 to indicate acknowledgement.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once a SESS_TERM message is sent the state of that TCPCL session
          changes to Ending.
          While the session is in the Ending state, an entity MAY finish an in-progress
          transfer in either direction.
          While the session is in the Ending state, an entity SHALL NOT begin any new outgoing
          transfer for the remainder of the session.
          While the session is in the Ending state, an entity SHALL NOT accept any new incoming
          transfer for the remainder of the session.
        </t>
        <t>
          Instead of following a clean termination sequence, after transmitting a
          SESS_TERM message an entity MAY immediately close
          the associated TCP connection.
          When performing an unclean termination, a receiving node SHOULD
          acknowledge all received XFER_SEGMENTs with an XFER_ACK 
          before closing the TCP connection.
          Not acknowledging received segments can result in unnecessary bundle 
          or bundle fragment retransmission.
          When performing an unclean termination, a transmitting node SHALL treat
          either sending or receiving a SESS_TERM message
          (i.e., before the final acknowledgment) as a failure of the transfer.
          Any delay between request to close the TCP connection and actual
          closing of the connection (a &quot;half-closed&quot; state) MAY be ignored
          by the TCPCL entity.
        </t>
        <t>
          The TCPCL itself does not have any required behavior to respond to an
          SESS_TERM based on its Reason Code;
          the termination is passed up as an indication to the BP agent 
          that the session state has changed.
          If a termination has a Reason Code which is not decodable to 
          the BP agent, the agent SHOULD treat the termination as having an 
          Unknown reason.

          The earliest a TCPCL session termination MAY occur is immediately 
          after transmission of a
          Contact Header (and prior to any further message transmit).
          This can, for example, be used to notify
          that the entity is currently not able or willing to communicate.
          However, an entity MUST always send the Contact Header to its peer
          before sending a SESS_TERM message.
        </t>
        <t>
          Termination of the TCP connection MAY occur prior to receiving the Contact
          header as discussed in <xref target="sec-tcp-connection" />.
          If reception of the Contact Header itself somehow fails (e.g., an invalid
          "magic string" is received), an entity SHALL close the TCP connection
          without sending a SESS_TERM message.
        </t>
        <t>
          If a session is to be terminated before a protocol message
          has completed being sent, then the entity MUST NOT transmit the SESS_TERM
          message but still SHALL close the TCP connection.
          Each TCPCL message is contiguous in the octet stream and has no ability
          to be cut short and/or preempted by an other message.
          This is particularly important when large segment sizes
          are being transmitted; either entire XFER_SEGMENT is sent before a SESS_TERM
          message or the connection is simply terminated mid-XFER_SEGMENT.

          The protocol includes a provision for clean termination of idle

          implementation and configuration matter.

        The description of implementations in this section is
        intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
        drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual

        and is intended to use as a proof-of-concept and as a possible source
        of interoperability testing.
        This example implementation uses D-Bus as the CL-BP Agent interface,

      <section title="Threat: Passive Leak of Node Data">
        <t>
When used without TLS security, the TCPCL exposes the Node ID and other
configuration data to passive eavesdroppers.
This occurs even when no transfers occur within a TCPCL session.
This can be avoided by always using TLS, even if authentication is not 
available (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsalt" />).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Threat: Passive Leak of Bundle Data">
        <t>
TCPCL can be used to provide point-to-point transport security, but does
not provide security of data-at-rest and does not guarantee
end-to-end bundle security.
The bundle security mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec" />
are to be used instead.
        </t>
        <t>
When used without TLS security, the TCPCL exposes all bundle data to passive
eavesdroppers.
This can be avoided by always using TLS, even if authentication is not 
available (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsalt" />).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Threat: TCPCL Version Downgrade">
        <t>
When a TCPCL entity supports multiple versions of the protocol it is possible
for a malicious or misconfigured peer to use an older version of TCPCL which
does not support transport security.
A man-in-the-middle attacker can also manipulate a Contact Header to present
a lower protocol version than desired.
        </t>
        <t>
It is up to security policies within each TCPCL node to ensure that the
negotiated TCPCL version meets transport security requirements.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Threat: Transport Security Stripping">
        <t>
When security policy allows non-TLS sessions,
TCPCL does not protect against active network attackers.
It is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to
set the CAN_TLS flag to 0 on either side of the Contact Header exchange.
This leads to the "SSL Stripping" attack described in <xref target="RFC7457" />.
        </t>
        <t>
The purpose of the CAN_TLS flag is to allow the use of TCPCL on
entities which simply do not have a TLS implementation available.
When TLS is available on an entity, it is strongly encouraged
that the security policy disallow non-TLS sessions.
This requires that the TLS handshake occurs, regardless of the 
policy-driven parameters of the handshake and policy-driven handling

      <section title="Threat: Weak TLS Configurations">
        <t>
Even when using TLS to secure the TCPCL session, the actual ciphersuite
negotiated between the TLS peers can be insecure.
Recommendations for ciphersuite use are included in BCP 195 <xref target="RFC7525" />.
It is up to security policies within each TCPCL node to ensure that the
negotiated TLS ciphersuite meets transport security requirements.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Threat: Certificate Validation Vulnerabilities">
        <t>
Even when TLS itself is operating properly an attacker can attempt to exploit
vulnerabilities within certificate check algorithms or configuration 
to establish a secure TCPCL session using an invalid certificate.
A BP agent treats the peer Node ID within a TCPCL session as authoritative and an
invalid certificate exploit could lead to bundle data leaking and/or denial of
service to the Node ID being impersonated.
There are many reasons, described in <xref target="RFC5280" />, why a 
certificate can fail to validate, including using the certificate outside
of its valid time interval, using purposes for which it was not authorized,
or using it after it has been revoked by its CA.
Validating a certificate is a complex task and can require network connectivity
outside of the primary TCPCL network path(s)
if a mechanism such as the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is used
by the CA.
The configuration and use of particular certificate validation methods are 
outside of the scope of this document.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Threat: Symmetric Key Limits">
        <t>
Even with a secure block cipher and securely-established session keys,
there are limits to the amount of plaintext which can be safely 
encrypted with a given set of keys as described in 
<xref target="AEAD-LIMITS" />.
When permitted by the negotiated TLS version 
(see <xref target="RFC8446" />), it is advisable to take
advantage of session key updates to avoid those limits.
When key updates are not possible, renegotiation of the TLS connection or
establishing new TCPCL/TLS session
are alternatives to limit session key use.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-node-impersonation" title="Threat: BP Node Impersonation">
        <t>
The certificates exchanged by TLS enable authentication of peer
host name and Node ID, but it is possible that a peer either not
provide a valid certificate or that the certificate does not validate
either the host name or Node ID of the peer (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env" />).
Having a CA-validated certificate does not alone guarantee the identity
of the network host or BP node from which the certificate is provided;
additional validation procedures in <xref target="sec-tls-handshake" />
bind the host name or node ID based on the contents of the certificate.
        </t>
        <t>
The host name validation is a weaker form of authentication, because 
even if a peer is operating on an authenticated network host name it
can provide an invalid Node ID and cause bundles to be "leaked" to
an invalid node.
Especially in DTN environments, network names and addresses of nodes
can be time-variable so binding a certificate to a Node ID is a more 
stable identity.
        </t>
        <t>
Node ID validation ensures that the peer to which a bundle
is transferred is in fact the node which the BP Agent expects it to be.
It is a reasonable policy to skip host name validation if certificates
can be guaranteed to validate the peer's Node ID.
In circumstances where certificates can only be issued to network
host names, Node ID validation is not possible but it could be
reasonable to assume that a trusted host is not going to present an
invalid Node ID.
Determining of when a host name authentication can be trusted to validate
a Node ID is also a policy matter outside the scope of this document.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Threat: Denial of Service">
        <t>
The behaviors described in this section all amount to a potential 
denial-of-service to a TCPCL entity.
The denial-of-service could be limited to an individual TCPCL session,
could affect other well-behaving sessions on an entity, 
or could affect all sessions on a host.
        </t>
        <t>
A malicious entity can continually establish TCPCL sessions and delay sending
of protocol-required data to trigger timeouts.
The victim entity can block TCP connections from network peers which are
thought to be incorrectly behaving within TCPCL.
        </t>
        <t>
An entity can send a large amount of data over a TCPCL
session, requiring the receiving entity to handle the data.
The victim entity can attempt to stop the flood of data by sending an 
XFER_REFUSE message, or forcibly terminate the session.
        </t>
        <t>
There is the possibility of a "data dribble" attack in which
an entity presents a very small Segment MRU which causes transfers
to be split among an large number of very small segments and causes
the segmentation overhead to overwhelm the actual bundle data segments.
Similarly, an entity can present a very small Transfer MRU which will
cause resources to be wasted on establishment and upkeep of a
TCPCL session over which a bundle could never be transferred.
The victim entity can terminate the session during the negotiation
of <xref target="sec-session-negotiate" /> if the MRUs are unacceptable.
        </t>
        <t>
The keepalive mechanism can be abused to waste throughput within a network
link which would otherwise be usable for bundle transmissions.
Due to the quantization of the Keepalive Interval parameter the smallest
Session Keepalive is one second, which should be long enough to not flood
the link.
The victim entity can terminate the session during the negotiation
of <xref target="sec-session-negotiate" /> if the Keepalive Interval
is unacceptable.
        </t>
        <t>
Finally, an attacker or a misconfigured entity can cause issues at the TCP
connection which will cause unnecessary TCP retransmissions or connection resets,
effectively denying the use of the overlying TCPCL session.

      <section anchor="sec-security-tlsalt" title="Alternate Uses of TLS">
        <t>
This specification makes use of PKIX certificate validation and authentication within TLS.
There are alternate uses of TLS which are not necessarily incompatible with the security goals of this specification, but are outside of the scope of this document.
The following subsections give examples of alternate TLS uses.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec-security-tlsnoauth" title="TLS Without Authentication">
          <t>
In environments where PKI is available but there are restrictions on
the issuance of certificates (including the contents of certificates),
it may be possible to make use of TLS in a way which authenticates only the
passive entity of a TCPCL session or which does not authenticate either entity.
Using TLS in a way which does not authenticate both peer entities of each
TCPCL session is outside of the scope of this document but does have similar
properties to the opportunistic security model of <xref target="RFC7435" />.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sec-security-tlsnopki" title="Non-Certificate TLS Use">
          <t>
In environments where PKI is unavailable,
alternate uses of TLS which do not require certificates such as 
pre-shared key (PSK) authentication <xref target="RFC5489" /> and the use of
raw public keys <xref target="RFC7250" />
are available and can be used to ensure confidentiality within TCPCL.
Using non-PKI node authentication methods is outside of the scope of this 
document.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-security-xferid" title="Predictability of Transfer IDs">
        <t>
The only requirement on Transfer IDs is that they be unique with each session
from the sending peer only.
The trivial algorithm of the first transfer starting at zero and later 
transfers incrementing by one causes absolutely predictable Transfer IDs.
Even when a TCPCL session is not TLS secured and there is a man-in-the-middle
attacker causing denial of service with XFER_REFUSE messages, it is not possible
to preemptively refuse a transfer so there is no benefit in having unpredictable
Transfer IDs within a session.

        Some of the registries have been defined as version specific to 
        TCPCLv4, and imports some or all codepoints from TCPCLv3.
        This was done to disambiguate the use of these codepoints

          reference is updated to this specification.
          Each TCPCL entity identifies its TCPCL protocol version in its initial

        <t>
          IANA will create, under the &quot;Bundle Protocol&quot; registry
          <xref target="IANA-BUNDLE" />, a sub-registry titled
          &quot;Bundle Protocol TCP Convergence-Layer Version 4 MSG_REJECT Reason Codes&quot;
          and initialize it with the contents of
          <xref target="tab-iana-MSG_REJECT-codes" />.
          The registration procedure is Specification Required within the lower range 0x01--0xEF.
          Values in the range 0xF0--0xFF are reserved for use on private networks
          for functions not published to the IANA.
        </t>
        <t>
          Specifications of new MSG_REJECT reason codes need to define the
          meaning of the reason and disambiguate it with pre-existing 
          reasons.
          Each rejection reason needs to be usable by the receiving TCPCL Entity to make
          message sequencing and/or session termination decisions.

      <t>
The areas in which changes from <xref target="RFC7242" /> have been made to existing headers and messages are:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Split Contact Header into pre-TLS protocol negotiation and SESS_INIT parameter negotiation. The Contact Header is now fixed-length.</t>
          <t>Changed Contact Header content to limit number of negotiated options.</t>
          <t>Added session option to negotiate maximum segment size (per each direction).</t>
          <t>Renamed "Endpoint ID" to "Node ID" to conform with BPv7 terminology.</t>
          <t>Added session extension capability.</t>
          <t>Added transfer extension capability. Moved transfer total length into an extension item.</t>
          <t>Defined new IANA registries for message / type / reason codes to allow renaming some codes for clarity.</t>
          <t>Segments of all new IANA registries are reserved for private/experimental use.</t>
          <t>Expanded Message Header to octet-aligned fields instead of bit-packing.</t>
          <t>Added a bundle transfer identification number to all bundle-related messages (XFER_SEGMENT, XFER_ACK, XFER_REFUSE).</t>
          <t>Use flags in XFER_ACK to mirror flags from XFER_SEGMENT.</t>
          <t>Removed all uses of SDNV fields and replaced with fixed-bit-length (network byte order) fields.</t>
          <t>Renamed SHUTDOWN to SESS_TERM to deconflict term "shutdown" related to TCP connections.</t>
          <t>Removed the notion of a re-connection delay parameter.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

The areas in which extensions from <xref target="RFC7242" /> have been made as new messages and codes are:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Added contact negotiation failure SESS_TERM reason code.</t>
