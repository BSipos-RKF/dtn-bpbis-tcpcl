      <t>
        This document describes a revised protocol for the TCP-based convergence
        layer (TCPCL) for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).
        The protocol revision is based on implementation issues in the original
        TCPCL Version 3 of RFC7242 and updates to the Bundle Protocol contents,
        encodings, and convergence layer requirements in Bundle Protocol Version 7.
        Specifically, the TCPCLv4 uses CBOR-encoded BPv7 bundles as its service data
        unit being transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles.
        Several new IANA registries are defined for TCPCLv4 which define some
        behaviors inherited from TCPCLv3 but with updated encodings and/or semantics.

      <t>
        This document describes the TCP-based convergence-layer protocol for
        Delay-Tolerant Networking. Delay-Tolerant Networking is an end-to-
        end architecture providing communications in and/or through highly
        stressed environments, including those with intermittent
        connectivity, long and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates.
        More detailed descriptions of the rationale and capabilities of these
        networks can be found in &quot;Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture&quot;
        <xref target="RFC4838" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        An important goal of the DTN architecture is to accommodate a wide
        range of networking technologies and environments. The protocol used
        for DTN communications is the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7)
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis" />,
        an
        application-layer protocol that is used to construct a store-and-forward
        overlay network.
        BPv7 requires the services of a &quot;convergence-layer adapter&quot; (CLA)
        to send and receive bundles using the service of
        some &quot;native&quot; link, network, or Internet protocol.
        This document describes one such convergence-layer adapter that uses the
        well-known Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
        This convergence layer is referred to as TCP Convergence Layer Version 4 (TCPCLv4).
        For the remainder of this document, the abbreviation &quot;BP&quot;
        without the version suffix refers to BPv7.
        For the remainder of this document, the abbreviation &quot;TCPCL&quot;
        without the version suffix refers to TCPCLv4.
      </t>
      <t>
        The locations of the TCPCL and the BP in the Internet model protocol
        stack (described in
        <xref target="RFC1122" />) are shown in Figure 1.
        In particular, when BP is using TCP as its bearer with TCPCL as its
        convergence layer, both BP and TCPCL reside at the application layer
        of the Internet model.

          This version of the TCPCL provides the following services to support
          the overlaying Bundle Protocol agent.
          In all cases, this is not an API defintion but a logical description
          of how the CL may interact with the BP agent.
          Each of these interactions may be associated with any number of 
          additional metadata items as necessary to support the operation
          of the CL or BP agent.
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Attempt Session">
              The TCPCL allows a BP agent to pre-emptively attempt to establish
              a TCPCL session with a peer entity.
              Each session attempt can send a different set of session negotiation
              parameters as directed by the BP agent.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Terminate Session">
              The TCPCL allows a BP agent to pre-emptively terminate an established
              TCPCL session with a peer entity.
              The terminate request is on a per-session basis.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Session State Changed">
              The TCPCL supports indication when the session state changes.
              The top-level session states indicated are:
              <list>
                <t hangText="Contact Negotating:">A TCP connection has been made (as either active or passive entity) and contact negotiation has begun.</t>
                <t hangText="Session Negotiating:">Contact negotation has been completed (including possible TLS use) and session negotiation has begun.</t>
                <t hangText="Established:">The session has been fully established and is ready for its first transfer.</t>
                <t hangText="Closing:">The entity received a SESS_TERM message and is in the closing state.</t>
                <t hangText="Terminated:">The session has finished normal termination sequencing..</t>
                <t hangText="Failed:">The session ended without normal termination sequencing.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t hangText="Session Idle Changed">
              The TCPCL supports indication when the live/idle sub-state changes.
              This occurs only when the top-level session state is Established.
              Because TCPCL transmits serially over a TCP connection, it suffers
              from "head of queue blocking" this indication provides
              information about when a session is available for
              immediate transfer start.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Begin Transmission">
              The principal purpose of the TCPCL is to allow a BP agent to
              transmit bundle data over an established TCPCL session.
              Transmission request is on a per-session basis, the CL does not
              necessarily perform any per-session or inter-session queueing.
              Any queueing of transmissions is the obligation of the BP agent.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Transmission Success">
              The TCPCL supports positive indication when a bundle has been fully
              transferred to a peer entity.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Transmission Intermediate Progress">
              The TCPCL supports positive indication of intermediate progress
              of transferr to a peer entity.
              This intermediate progress is at the granularity of each
              transferred segment.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Transmission Failure">
              The TCPCL supports positive indication of certain reasons for
              bundle transmission failure, notably when the peer entity rejects
              the bundle or when a TCPCL session ends before transferr success.
              The TCPCL itself does not have a notion of transfer timeout.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Reception Initialized">
              The TCPCL supports indication to the reciver just before any
              transmssion data is sent.
              This corresponds to reception of the XFER_SEGMENT message with
              the START flag set.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Interrupt Reception">
              The TCPCL allows a BP agent to interrupt an individual transfer
              before it has fully completed (successfully or not).
              Interruption can occur any time after the reception is initialized.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Reception Success">
              The TCPCL supports positive indication when a bundle has been fully
              transferred from a peer entity.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Reception Intermediate Progress">
              The TCPCL supports positive indication of intermediate progress
              of transfer from the peer entity.
              This intermediate progress is at the granularity of each
              transferred segment.
              Intermediate reception indication allows a BP agent the chance
              to inspect bundle header contents before the entire bundle is
              available, and thus supports the
              &quot;Reception Interruption&quot; capability.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Reception Failure">
              The TCPCL supports positive indication of certain reasons for
              reception failure, notably when the local entity rejects an attempted
              transfer for some local policy reason or when a TCPCL session
              ends before transfer success.
              The TCPCL itself does not have a notion of transfer timeout.

              This is the notional TCPCL application that initiates TCPCL sessions.
              This design, implementation, configuration, and specific behavior of such
              an entity is outside of the scope of this document.
              However, the concept of an entity has utility within the scope of 
              this document as the container and initiator of TCPCL sessions.
              The relationship between a TCPCL entity and TCPCL sessions is defined as follows:
              <list>
                <t>
                  A TCPCL Entity MAY actively initiate any number of TCPCL Sessions and should do so 
                  whenever the entity is the initial transmitter of information to another entity in the network.
                </t>
                <t>
                  A TCPCL Entity MAY support zero or more passive listening elements that listen for
                  connection requests from other TCPCL Entities operating on other entitys in the network.
                </t>
                <t>
                  A TCPCL Entity MAY passivley initiate any number of TCPCL Sessions from requests received
                  by its passive listening element(s) if the entity uses such elements.
                </t>
              </list>
              These relationships are illustrated in <xref target="fig-entity-session-relations"/>.
              For most TCPCL behavior within a session, the two entities are 
              symmetric and there is no protocol distinction between them.
              Some specific behavior, particularly during session establishment, distinguishes
              between the active entity and the passive entity.
              For the remainder of this document, the term &quot;entity&quot;
              without the prefix &quot;TCPCL&quot; refers to a TCPCL entity.

            <t hangText="TCP Connection:">
              The term Connection in this specification exclusively refers to a TCP connection

            <t hangText="TCPCL Session:">
              A TCPCL session (as opposed to a TCP connection) is a TCPCL 
              communication relationship between two TCPCL entities.
              Within a single TCPCL session there are two possible transfer streams;
              one in each direction, with one stream from each entity being the outbound
              stream and the other being the inbound stream.
              The lifetime of a TCPCL session is bound to the lifetime of an underlying TCP connection.
              A TCPCL session is terminated when the TCP
              connection ends, due either to one or both entities actively
              terminating the TCP connection or due to network errors causing
              a failure of the TCP connection.
              For the remainder of this document, the term &quot;session&quot;
              without the prefix &quot;TCPCL&quot; refers to a TCPCL session.

              These are a set of
              values used to affect the operation of the TCPCL for a given
              session. The manner in which these parameters are conveyed
              to the bundle entity and thereby to the TCPCL is implementation
              dependent. However, the mechanism by which two entities
              exchange and negotiate the values to be used for a given session
              is described in

            <t hangText="Transfer Stream:">
              A Transfer stream is a uni-directional user-data path within a TCPCL Session.
              Messages sent over a transfer stream are serialized, meaning that one set of 
              user data must complete its transmission prior to another set of user data 
              being transmitted over the same transfer stream.
              Each uni-directional stream has a single sender entity and a single receiver entity.

    <section anchor="sec-prococol" title="General Protocol Description">
      <t>
        The service of this protocol is the transmission of DTN bundles via
        the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
        This document specifies the encapsulation of bundles,
        procedures for TCP setup and teardown, and a set of messages and node
        requirements.
        The general operation of the protocol is as follows.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-protocol-session" title="TCPCL Session Overview">
        <t>
          First, one node establishes a TCPCL session to the other by
          initiating a TCP connection in accordance with
          <xref target="RFC0793" />.
          After setup of the TCP connection is
          complete, an initial contact header is exchanged in both directions
          to establish a shared TCPCL version and possibly initiate TLS security.
          Once contact negotiation is complete, TCPCL messaging is available and
          the session negotiation is used to set parameters of the TCPCL session.
          One of these parameters is a singleton
          endpoint identifier for each node (not the singleton Endpoint
          Identifier (EID) of any application running on the node) to denote
          the bundle-layer identity of each DTN node. This is used to assist
          in routing and forwarding messages (e.g. to prevent loops).
        </t>
        <t>
          Once negotiated, the parameters of a TCPCL session cannot change
          and if there is a desire by either peer to transfer data under 
          different parameters then a new session must be established.
          This makes CL logic simpler but relies on the assumption that
          establishing a TCP connection is lightweight enough that TCP 
          connection overhead is negligable compared to TCPCL data sizes.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once the TCPCL session is established and configured in this way,
          bundles can be transferred in either direction.
          Each transfer is performed by an sequence of 
          logical segments of data within XFER_SEGMENT messages.
          Multiple bundles can be transmitted consecutively in a single 
          direction on a single TCPCL connection.
          Segments from different bundles are never interleaved.
          Bundle interleaving can be
          accomplished by fragmentation at the BP layer or by establishing multiple
          TCPCL sessions between the same peers.
        </t>
        <t>
          A feature of this protocol is for the receiving node to send
          acknowledgment (XFER_ACK) messages as bundle data segments arrive. The
          rationale behind these acknowledgments is to enable the sender node
          to determine how much of the bundle has been received, so that in
          case the session is interrupted, it can perform reactive
          fragmentation to avoid re-sending the already transmitted part of the
          bundle.
          In addition, there is no explicit flow control on the TCPCL
          layer.
        </t>
        <t>
          A TCPCL receiver can interrupt the
          transmission of a bundle at any point in time by replying with a
          XFER_REFUSE message, which causes the sender to stop transmission
          of the associated bundle (if it hasn't already finished transmission)
          Note: This enables a cross-layer optimization in
          that it allows a receiver that detects that it already has received a
          certain bundle to interrupt transmission as early as possible and
          thus save transmission capacity for other bundles.
        </t>
        <t>
          For sessions that are idle, a KEEPALIVE message is
          sent at a negotiated interval.
          This is used to convey node live-ness information during otherwise
          message-less time intervals.
        </t>
        <t>
          A SESS_TERM message is used to start the closing of a TCPCL session
          (see
          <xref target="sec-SESS_TERM" />).
          During shutdown sequencing, in-progress transfers can be completed but no
          new transfers can be initiated.
          A SESS_TERM message can also be used to refuse a session setup by a
          peer (see
          <xref target="sec-contact-negotiate" />).
          It is an implementation matter to determine whether or not to close a
          TCPCL session while there are no transfers queued or in-progress.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once a session is established established, 
          TCPCL is a symmetric protocol between the peers.
          Both sides can start sending data segments in a session, and one
          side's bundle transfer does not have to complete before the other
          side can start sending data segments on its own. Hence, the protocol
          allows for a bi-directional mode of communication.
          Note that in the case of concurrent bidirectional transmission,
          acknowledgment segments MAY be interleaved with data segments.

          It is a network administration matter to determine an appropriate
          segmentation policy for entities operating TCPCL, but guidance given
          here can be used to steer policy toward performance goals.
          It is also advised to consider the Segment MRU in relation to 
          chunking/packetization performed by TLS, TCP, and any intermediate
          network-layer nodes.

              For a simple network expected to exchange relatively small bundles,
              the Segment MRU can be set to be identical to the Transfer MRU which
              indicates that all transfers can be sent with a single data
              segment (i.e. no actual segmentation).
              If the network is closed and all transmitters are known to follow
              a single-segment transfer policy, then receivers can avoid the 
              necessity of segment reassembly.
              Because this CL operates over a TCP stream, which suffers from
              a form of head-of-queue blocking between messages, while one
              node is transmitting a single XFER_SEGMENT message it is not
              able to transmit any XFER_ACK or XFER_REFUSE for any associated

              message size less XFER_SEGMENT header size) and transmitters
              can always segment a transfer into maximum-size chunks no larger
              than the Segment MRU.
              This guarantees that any single XFER_SEGMENT will not monopolize
              the TCP stream for too long, which would prevent outgoing

              In a situation where network &quot;goodput&quot; is dynamic, the transfer

          Many other policies can be established in a TCPCL network between

          Different policies can be applied to each direction to/from any 
          particular node.
          Additionally, future header and transfer extension types can apply
          further nuance to transfer policies and policy negotiation.

          The following figure depicts the protocol exchange for a
          simple session, showing the session establishment and the
          transmission of a single bundle split into three data segments (of
          lengths &quot;L1&quot;, &quot;L2&quot;, and &quot;L3&quot;) from Entity A to Entity B.

          Note that the sending node can transmit multiple XFER_SEGMENT
          messages without waiting for the corresponding
          XFER_ACK responses. This enables pipelining of messages on a
          transfer stream. Although this example only demonstrates a single bundle
          transmission, it is also possible to pipeline multiple XFER_SEGMENT
          messages for different bundles without necessarily waiting for
          XFER_ACK messages to be returned for each one. However,
          interleaving data segments from different bundles is not allowed.

    <section title="Session Establishment">
      <t>
        For bundle transmissions to occur using the TCPCL, a TCPCL session
        MUST first be established between communicating entities. It is up to
        the implementation to decide how and when session setup is
        triggered. For example, some sessions MAY be opened proactively
        and maintained for as long as is possible given the network
        conditions, while other sessions MAY be opened only when there is
        a bundle that is queued for transmission and the routing algorithm
        selects a certain next-hop node.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-tcp-connection" title="TCP Connection">
        <t>
          To establish a TCPCL session, an entity MUST first establish a TCP
          connection with the intended peer entity, typically by using the
          services provided by the operating system.
          Destination port number 4556 has been assigned by IANA as the Registered
          Port number for the TCP convergence layer.
          Other destination port numbers MAY be used per local configuration.
          Determining a peer's destination port number (if different from the
          registered TCPCL port number) is up to the implementation.
          Any source port number MAY be used for TCPCL sessions.
          Typically an operating system assigned number in the TCP Ephemeral range
          (49152-65535) is used.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the entity is unable to establish a TCP connection for any reason,
          then it is an implementation matter to determine how to handle the
          connection failure. An entity MAY decide to re-attempt to establish the
          connection. If it does so, it MUST NOT overwhelm its target with
          repeated connection attempts. Therefore, the entity MUST retry the
          connection setup no earlier than some delay time from the last attempt,
          and it SHOULD use a (binary) exponential backoff
          mechanism to increase this delay in case of repeated failures.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once a TCP connection is established, each entity MUST immediately
          transmit a contact header over the TCP connection. The format of the
          contact header is described in
          <xref target="sec-contact-header" />.

      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-contact-header" title="Contact Header">
        <t>
          Once a TCP connection is established, both parties exchange a contact
          header. This section describes the format of the contact header and
          the meaning of its fields.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receipt of the contact header, both entities perform the validation
          and negotiation procedures defined in
          <xref target="sec-contact-negotiate" />.
          After receiving the contact header from the other entity, either entity

          Upon reception of the contact header, each node follows the following
          procedures to ensure the validity of the TCPCL session and to
          negotiate values for the session parameters.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the magic string is not present or is not valid, the connection
          MUST be terminated. The intent of the magic string is to provide
          some protection against an inadvertent TCP connection by a different
          protocol than the one described in this document. To prevent a flood
          of repeated connections from a misconfigured application, an entity MAY
          elect to hold an invalid connection open and idle for some time
          before closing it.
        </t>
        <t>
          The first negotiation is on the TCPCL protocol version to use.
          The active node always sends its Contact Header first and waits for
          a response from the passive node.
          The active node can repeatedly attempt different protocol versions
          in descending order until the passive node accepts one with a
          corresponding Contact Header reply.
          Only upon response of a Contact Header from the passive node is
          the TCPCL protocol version established and parameter negotiation begun.
        </t>
        <t>
          During contact initiation, the active TCPCL node SHALL send the highest TCPCL protocol
          version on a first session attempt for a TCPCL peer.
          If the active node receives a Contact Header with a different
          protocol version than the one sent earlier on the TCP connection,
          the TCP connection SHALL be terminated.
          If the active node receives a SESS_TERM message with reason of
          "Version Mismatch", that node MAY attempt further TCPCL sessions with the
          peer using earlier protocol version numbers in decreasing order.
          Managing multi-TCPCL-session state such as this is an implementation matter.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the passive node receives a contact header containing a version that is
          greater than the current version of the protocol that the node
          implements, then the node SHALL shutdown the session with a reason code
          of "Version mismatch".
          If the passive node receives a contact header with a
          version that is lower than the version of the protocol that the node
          implements, the node MAY either terminate the session (with a reason code
          of "Version mismatch") or the node MAY adapt its operation to
          conform to the older version of the protocol.
          The decision of version fall-back is an implementation matter.

        <t>
          This version of the TCPCL supports establishing a Transport
          Layer Security (TLS) session within an existing TCP connection.
          When TLS is used within the TCPCL it affects the entire session.
          Once established, there is no mechanism available to downgrade a
          TCPCL session to non-TLS operation.
          If this is desired, the entire TCPCL session MUST be terminated and a new
          non-TLS-negotiated session established.
        </t>
        <t>
          The use of TLS is negotated using the Contact Header as described
          in

          After negotiating an Enable TLS parameter of true, and before any other
          TCPCL messages are sent within the session, the session entities SHALL
          begin a TLS handshake in accordance with
          <xref target="RFC5246" />.
          The parameters within each TLS negotiation are implementation dependent but
          any TCPCL node SHALL follow all recommended practices of 
          <xref target="BCP195" />, or any updates or successors that 
          become part of <xref target="BCP195" />.
          By convention, this protocol uses the node which initiated the
          underlying TCP connection as the &quot;client&quot; role
          of the TLS handshake request.
        </t>
        <t>
          The TLS handshake, if it occurs, is considered to be part of the contact
          negotiation before the TCPCL session itself is established.

            At this point the TCPCL session has not yet been established so there
            is no TCPCL session to terminate.
            This also avoids any potential security issues assoicated with

            The protocol includes a provision for transmission of KEEPALIVE

            As described in
            <xref target="sec-contact-negotiate" />,
            a negotiated parameter of each session is the Session Keepalive interval.
            If the negotiated Session Keepalive is zero (i.e. one or both contact
            headers contains a zero Keepalive Interval), then the keepalive feature
            is disabled.
            There is no logical minimum value for the keepalive interval, but when
            used for many sessions on an open, shared network a short interval could
            lead to excessive traffic.
            For shared network use, entities SHOULD choose a keepalive interval
            no shorter than 30 seconds.
            There is no logical maximum value for the keepalive interval, but an
            idle TCP connection is liable for closure by the host operating system
            if the keepalive time is longer than tens-of-minutes.
            Entities SHOULD choose a keepalive interval no longer than 10 minutes
            (600 seconds).
          </t>
          <t>
            Note: The Keepalive Interval SHOULD NOT be chosen too short as TCP
            retransmissions MAY occur in case of packet loss. Those will have to
            be triggered by a timeout (TCP retransmission timeout (RTO)), which
            is dependent on the measured RTT for the TCP connection so that
            KEEPALIVE messages MAY experience noticeable latency.

            The format of a KEEPALIVE message is a one-octet message type code of

            <xref target="tab-msg-types" />) with no additional data.
            Both sides SHALL send a KEEPALIVE message whenever the negotiated
            interval has elapsed with no transmission of any message (KEEPALIVE
            or other).

            session by transmitting a SESS_TERM message (as described in
            <xref target="sec-SESS_TERM" />) with reason code "Idle Timeout".
            If configurable, the idle timeout duration SHOULD be no shorter

      <section anchor="sec-transfer" title="Bundle Transfer">
        <t>
          All of the messages in this section are directly associated with transferring
          a bundle between TCPCL entities.
        </t>
        <t>
          A single TCPCL transfer results in a bundle (handled by the convergence layer
          as opaque data) being exchanged from one node to the other.
          In TCPCL a transfer is accomplished by dividing a single bundle up into
          &quot;segments&quot; based on the receiving-side Segment MRU
          (see
          <xref target="sec-contact-header" />).
          The choice of the length to use for segments is an implementation matter,
          but each segment MUST be no larger than the receiving node's maximum
          receive unit (MRU)
          (see the field "Segment MRU" of
          <xref target="sec-contact-header" />).
          The first segment for a bundle MUST set the 'START' flag,
          and the last one MUST set the 'end' flag in the XFER_SEGMENT message flags.
        </t>
        <t>
          A single transfer (and by extension a single segment) SHALL NOT contain data
          of more than a single bundle.
          This requirement is imposed on the agent using the TCPCL rather than TCPCL itself.
        </t>
        <t>
          If multiple bundles are transmitted on a single TCPCL connection,
          they MUST be transmitted consecutively without interleaving of segments from multiple bundles.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec-transfer-id" title="Bundle Transfer ID">
          <t>
            Each of the bundle transfer messages contains a Transfer ID which is
            used to correlate messages (from both sides of a transfer) for each bundle.
            A Transfer ID does not attempt to address uniqueness of the bundle data itself
            and has no relation to concepts such as bundle fragmentation.
            Each invocation of TCPCL by the bundle protocol agent, requesting transmission
            of a bundle (fragmentary or otherwise), results in the initiation of a single
            TCPCL transfer. Each transfer entails the sending of a sequence of
            some number of XFER_SEGMENT and XFER_ACK messages; all are correlated
            by the same Transfer ID.
          </t>
          <t>
            Transfer IDs from each node SHALL be unique within a single TCPCL session.
            The initial Transfer ID from each node SHALL have value zero.
            Subsequent Transfer ID values SHALL be incremented from the prior Transfer ID
            value by one.
            Upon exhaustion of the entire 64-bit Transfer ID space, the sending node
            SHALL terminate the session with SESS_TERM reason code "Resource Exhaustion".
          </t>
          <t>
            For bidirectional bundle transfers, a TCPCL node SHOULD NOT rely on any
            relation between Transfer IDs originating from each side of the TCPCL session.

            The 'START' bit MUST be set to one if it precedes the transmission of the first

            The 'END' bit MUST be set to one when transmitting the last segment of a transfer.
            In the case where an entire transfer is accomplished in a single segment,

            No interleaving of multiple transfers from the same node is possible
            within a single TCPCL session.
            Simultaneous transfers between two entities MAY be achieved using multiple

          <t>
            Although the TCP transport provides reliable transfer of data between
            transport peers, the typical BSD sockets interface provides no means
            to inform a sending application of when the receiving application has
            processed some amount of transmitted data.
            Thus, after transmitting some data, the TCPCL needs an additional mechanism to
            determine whether the receiving agent has successfully received the
            segment.
            To this end, the TCPCL protocol provides feedback messaging whereby a
            receiving node transmits acknowledgments of reception of data
            segments.

            A receiving TCPCL node SHALL send an XFER_ACK message in response to

            The flags portion of the XFER_ACK header SHALL be set to match the
            corresponding DATA_SEGMENT message being acknowledged.
            The acknowledged length of each XFER_ACK contains the sum of the
            data length fields of all XFER_SEGMENT messages received so far in the
            course of the indicated transfer.
            The sending node SHOULD transmit multiple XFER_SEGMENT
            messages without waiting for the corresponding
            XFER_ACK responses.

            After receiving the first segment, the node sends an acknowledgment
            of length 100. After the second segment is received, the node sends
            an acknowledgment of length 300. The third and fourth
            acknowledgments are of length 800 and 1800, respectively.

            The TCPCL supports a mechanism by which a receiving node can indicate to
            the sender that it does not want to receive the corresponding bundle.
            To do so, upon receiving an XFER_SEGMENT message, the node MAY
            transmit a XFER_REFUSE message. As data segments and
            acknowledgments MAY cross on the wire, the bundle that is being

            There is no required relation between the Transfer MRU of a TCPCL
            node (which is supposed to represent a firm limitation of what the
            node will accept) and sending of a XFER_REFUSE message.
            A XFER_REFUSE can be used in cases where the agent's bundle storage is
            temporarily depleted or somehow constrained.
            A XFER_REFUSE can also be used after the bundle header or any bundle data
            is inspected by an agent and determined to be unacceptable.

          <t>
            A receiver MAY send an XFER_REFUSE message as soon as it receives

            The sender MUST NOT commence transmission of any further segments of the
            refused bundle subsequently.
            Note, however, that this requirement does not ensure
            that an entity will not receive another XFER_SEGMENT for the same bundle

      <section anchor="sec-SESS_TERM" title="Session Termination Message (SESS_TERM)">
        <t>
          To cleanly shut down a session, a SESS_TERM message SHALL be
          transmitted by either node at any point following complete
          transmission of any other message.
          When sent to initiate a termination, the REPLY bit of a SESS_TERM message
          SHALL NOT be set.
          Upon receiving a SESS_TERM message after not sending a SESS_TERM message in
          the same session, an entity SHALL send an acknowledging SESS_TERM message.
          When sent to acknowledge a termination, a SESS_TERM message SHALL have
          identical data content from the message being acknowledged except for
          the REPLY bit, which is set to indicate acknowledgement.
        </t>
        <t>
          After sending a SESS_TERM message, an entity MAY continue a possible in-progress
          transfer in either direction.
          After sending a SESS_TERM message, an entity SHALL NOT begin any new outgoing
          transfer (i.e. send an XFER_SEGMENT message) for the remainder of the session.
          After receving a SESS_TERM message, an entity SHALL NOT accept any new incoming
          transfer for the remainder of the session.
        </t>
        <t>
          Instead of following a clean shutdown sequence, after transmitting a
          SESS_TERM message an entity MAY immediately close
          the associated TCP connection.
          When performing an unclean shutdown, a receiving node SHOULD
          acknowledge all received data segments before closing the TCP connection.
          Not acknowledging received segments can result in unnecessary retransmission.
          When performing an unclean shutodwn, a transmitting node SHALL treat
          either sending or receiving a SESS_TERM message
          (i.e. before the final acknowledgment) as a failure of the transfer.
          Any delay between request to terminate the TCP connection and actual
          closing of the connection (a &quot;half-closed&quot; state) MAY be ignored
          by the TCPCL node.

        <t>
          A session shutdown MAY occur immediately after transmission of a
          contact header (and prior to any further message transmit).
          This MAY, for example, be used to notify
          that the node is currently not able or willing to communicate.
          However, an entity MUST always send the contact header to its peer
          before sending a SESS_TERM message.
        </t>
        <t>
          If reception of the contact header itself somehow fails (e.g. an invalid
          "magic string" is recevied), an entity SHALL close the TCP connection
          without sending a SESS_TERM message.
          If the content of the Session Extension Items data disagrees with the
          Session Extension Length (i.e. the last Item claims to use more octets
          than are present in the Session Extension Length), the reception of the
          contact header is considered to have failed.
        </t>
        <t>
          If a session is to be terminated before a protocol message
          has completed being sent, then the node MUST NOT transmit the SESS_TERM
          message but still SHALL close the TCP connection.
          Each TCPCL message is contiguous in the octet stream and has no ability
          to be cut short and/or preempted by an other message.
          This is particularly important when large segment sizes
          are being transmitted; either entire XFER_SEGMENT is sent before a SESS_TERM
          message or the connection is simply terminated mid-XFER_SEGMENT.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-idle-shutdown" title="Idle Session Shutdown">
        <t>
          The protocol includes a provision for clean shutdown of idle
          sessions. Determining the length of time to wait before closing
          idle sessions, if they are to be closed at all, is an
          implementation and configuration matter.
        </t>
        <t>
          If there is a configured time to close idle links and if no TCPCL messages
          (other than KEEPALIVE messages) has been received for at least
          that amount of time, then either node MAY terminate the session by
          transmitting a SESS_TERM message indicating the reason code of "Idle
          timeout" (as described in
          <xref target="tab-SESS_TERM-reasons" />).

        This section records the status of known implementations of the
        protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
        this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
        <xref target="RFC7942" />.
        The description of implementations in this section is
        intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
        drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
        implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
        presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not
        intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
        implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that
        other implementations may exist.
      </t>
      <t>
        An example implementation of the this draft of TCPCLv4 has been
        created as a GitHub project
        <xref target="github-dtn-bpbis-tcpcl" />
        and is intented to use as a proof-of-concept and as a possible source
        of interoperability testing.
        This example implementation uses D-Bus as the CL-BP Agent interface,
        so it only runs on hosts which provide the Python "dbus" library.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        One security consideration for this protocol relates to the fact that
        entities present their endpoint identifier as part of the contact
        header exchange. It would be possible for an entity to fake this value
        and present the identity of a singleton endpoint in which the node is
        not a member, essentially masquerading as another DTN node. If this
        identifier is used outside of a TLS-secured session or
        without further verification as a means to
        determine which bundles are transmitted over the session, then the
        node that has falsified its identity would be able to obtain bundles
        that it otherwise would not have.
        Therefore, an entity SHALL NOT use the EID value of an unsecured contact header
        to derive a peer node's identity unless it can corroborate it via other
        means.
        When TCPCL session security is mandated by a TCPCL peer, that peer SHALL
        transmit initial unsecured contact header values indicated in
        <xref target="tab-empty-contact" />
        in order.
        These values avoid unnecessarily
        leaking session parameters and will be ignored when secure contact header
        re-exchange occurs.

      <t>
        TCPCL can be used to provide point-to-point transport security, but does
        not provide security of data-at-rest and does not guarantee
        end-to-end bundle security.
        The mechanisms defined in
        <xref target="RFC6257" />
        and
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec" />
        are to be used instead.
      </t>
      <t>
        Even when using TLS to secure the TCPCL session, the actual ciphersuite
        negotiated between the TLS peers MAY be insecure.
        TLS can be used to perform authentication without data confidentiality,
        for example.
        It is up to security policies within each TCPCL node to ensure that the
        negotiated TLS ciphersuite meets transport security requirements.
        This is identical behavior to STARTTLS use in
        <xref target="RFC2595" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another consideration for this protocol relates to denial-of-service
        attacks. An entity MAY send a large amount of data over a TCPCL
        session, requiring the receiving entity to handle the data, attempt
        to stop the flood of data by sending a XFER_REFUSE message, or
        forcibly terminate the session. This burden could cause denial of
        service on other, well-behaving sessions. There is also nothing
        to prevent a malicious entity from continually establishing sessions
        and repeatedly trying to send copious amounts of bundle data. A
        listening entity MAY take countermeasures such as ignoring TCP SYN
        messages, closing TCP connections as soon as they are established,
        waiting before sending the contact header, sending a SESS_TERM message
        quickly or with a delay, etc.

        Some of the registries below are created new for TCPCLv4 but share code

          <abstract>
            <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application
              protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP. Over the last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged, including
              attacks
              on its most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides recommendations for improving the security of
              deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.</t>

          <t>Added session extension capability.</t>
          <t>Added transfer extension capability. Moved transfer total length into an extension item.</t>
          <t>Defined new IANA registries for message / type / reason codes to allow renaming some codes for clarity.</t>
          <t>Expanded Message Header to octet-aligned fields instead of bit-packing.</t>
          <t>Added a bundle transfer identification number to all bundle-related messages (XFER_SEGMENT, XFER_ACK, XFER_REFUSE).</t>
          <t>Use flags in XFER_ACK to mirror flags from XFER_SEGMENT.</t>
          <t>Removed all uses of SDNV fields and replaced with fixed-bit-length fields.</t>
